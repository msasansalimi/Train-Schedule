# Train-Schedule
In this assignment I am using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Firebase to create a dynamic web page for the schedule of trains.
By entering train specifications and assigning the first time and frequency we will see all the inforamation on the wall
and by using timing methods in js, we calculate the next arrival time and minutes away to pop up on in table. 
As well we have all data`s in our firebase, real time. In this project we are initiating learning basics of database.
